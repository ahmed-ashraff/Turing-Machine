# Turing Machine Simulator With Java
This is a Simple Implementation of a semi-decidable Turing Machine that reads inputs from the user With the help of @NikolasTzimoulis: <br>
1- takes number of states <br>
2- alphabets like{a, b} <br>
3- number of machine Symbols <br>
4- Machine alphabets Gamma <br>
5- The Transitions <br>
6- The String to check if accepted or rejected <br>
7- the head position <br>
8- and asks him if he want to enter another String <br>
